# GifTastic

Did you ever wonder what some of the best gifs are of your favorite NFL team? Well wait no longer!

Here, I have created an app that allows you to generate 5 gifs of whatever NFL team you choose. I pulled the gifs from the giphy api and allowed each gif to start and stop at the click of your mouse! I used HTML, CSS, JS & jQuery to accomplish this task.

To start: Click any of the pre-generated buttons to see the magic work. Afterwards, feel free to add a team of your choice to join!
